# Sentiment_Analysis_Tweets_UsingRNNLSTM

In this report i have analyzed Twitter messages describing covid situation. This analysis will be used to develop a Crisis Management System. The given labelled twitter tweets describes the local covid situation. There is a requirement to build a classifier that classifies the tweets to five different classes. The classes being Extremely Negative (0), Negative (1),Neutral (2), Positive (3), Extremely Positive (4). The given tweet data has many unwanted text and symbols. I have created a method to remove the unwanted symbols, urls, stop words using nltk library. I have used tensorflowâ€™s Tokenizer to tokenize the data.For the building the classifier i have used Embedding model, Recurrent Neural Networks with LSTM and Bidirectional wrapper and Recurrent Neural Network with LSTM only. After training all the models with different hyperparameters for epochs upto 40 with early stopping to prevent overfitting it is found that, RNN LSTM with Bidirectional wrapper model has the best accuracy of 0.7 and ROC AUC score of 0.81.
